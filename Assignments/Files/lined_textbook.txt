164. 
165. 
166. The antiquity of the custom of giving and taking Oaths, or the debatable
167. questions of their observance being a religious or legal ceremony, and
168. whether the moral or political aspect has the greater effect upon the
169. minds of men, are subjects with which this paper has nothing to do.
170. 
171. And as the substance of Oaths for particular officers is to engage them
172. to a faithful discharge of their places and trusts to the best of their
173. ability, it has been considered, in general, unnecessary to give them,
174. especially as these offices carry with them the assumption that the
175. general Oaths required of all citizens have first been complied with. No
176. Oaths of office were administered or required in the New Plymouth
177. Colony, the power of the Church being, in effect, superior to the civil
178. power.
179. 
180. For the main purpose of this paper it will not be necessary to go
181. further back in history than to the reign of James the First, of
182. England, 1603–1625, during which time the providences of God directed
183. the course of the voyage of the Pilgrims away from the Colony of
184. Virginia to their settlement at Plymouth in New England, in December,
185. 1620; or to carry the subject beyond the time, in the short-lived reign
186. of James the Second, 1685–1689, when, in December, 1686, Sir Edmund
187. Andros, knight, arrived in Boston with a commission to govern New
188. England, and the Colonial period of New England came to an end.
189.

193. _In England._
194. 
195. 
196. When Henry the Eighth renounced the authority of the Pope, in 1534, an
197. Act of Parliament was obtained declaring him the only supreme head of
198. the Church in England on the earth; and utterly abolishing the authority
199. of the Roman Pontiff within the British Dominions. To give effect to
200. this Act there was further enacted:
201. 
202. 
203.                          THE OATH OF SUPREMACY
204. 
205.   I, A. B. do utterly testifie and declare in my Conscience, that the
206.   Kings Highness is the only Supream Governour of this Realm, and of
207.   all other His Highness Dominions and Countries, as well in all
208.   Spiritual and Ecclesiastical things (or causes) as Temporal: And
209.   that no Forraign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath,
210.   or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, preheminence
211.   or authority, Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm: and
212.   therefore I do utterly renounce and forsake all forreign
213.   jurisdiction, powers, superioritie, and authorities, and do promise
214.   that from henceforth I shall bear Faith and true Allegiance to the
215.   Kings Highness, His Heirs and lawful Successors, and (to my power)
216.   shall assist and defend all jurisdiction, priviledge, preheminence,
217.   & authority granted or belonging to the Kings Highness, His Heirs
218.   and Successors, and united and annexed to the imperial Crown of the
219.   Realm. So help me God, _&c._
220. 
221. The Act of Supremacy which broke the power of the Roman Catholic Church
222. in England, under Henry the Eighth, and his successor, Edward the Sixth,
223. was repealed under Mary Tudor, and revived under Elizabeth, in 1558.
224. Following the Gunpowder Plot, James the First, in 1605, had enacted an
225. Oath of Allegiance, also, which all British subjects were required to
226. take. This Oath of “submission and obedience to the King as a temporal
227. Sovereign, independent of any other power upon earth” contained no
228. acknowledgment of the King as the head of the Church, and, by this
229. omission, Roman Catholics could take it without denying the supremacy of
230. the Pope in spiritual affairs:
231. 
232. 
233.    TENOR OF THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE, &C. TO BE TAKEN AND SUBSCRIBED BY
234.                                RECUSANTS
235. 
236.   I. A.B. doe truely and sincerely acknowledge pfesse testifie and
237.   declare in my Conscience before God and the Worlde, That our
238.   Soveraigne Lorde Kinge James is lawfull and rightfull King of this
239.   Realme and of all other his Majesties Dominions and Countries; And
240.   that the Pope, neither of himselfe nor by any Authority of the
241.   Churche or Sea of Rome, or by any other meanes with any other, hath
242.   any Power or Authoritye to depose the King or to dispose any of his
243.   Majesties Kingdomes or Dominions, or to authorize any Forraigne
244.   Prince to invade or annoy hym or his Countries, or to discharge any
245.   of his Subjects of their Allegiaunce and Obedience to his Majestie,
246.   or to give Licence or Leave to any of them to beare Armes raise
247.   Tumult or to offer any violence or hurte to his Majestie Royall Pson
248.   State or Government or to any of his Majesties Subjects within his
249.   Majesties Dominions. Also I doe sweare from my heart, that
250.   notwithstanding any Declarac̄on or Sentence of Excommunicac̄on or
251.   Deprivac̄on made or graunted or to be made or graunted by the Pope
252.   or his Successors, or by any Authoritie derived or p̄tended to be
253.   derived from hym or his Sea against the saide King his Heires or
254.   Successors, or any Absolution of the saide Subjects from theire
255.   Obedience; I will beare Faithe and true Allegiaunce to his Majestie
256.   his Heires and Successors, and hym or them will defend to the
257.   uttermost of my power against all Conspiracies and Attempts
258.   whatsoever which shalbe made against his or theire persons theire
259.   Crowne and Dignitie by reason or colour of any such Sentence or
260.   Declarac̄on or otherwise, and will doe my best endevour to disclose
261.   and make knowen unto his Majestie his Heires and Successors all
262.   Treasons and traiterous Conspiracies which I shall knowe or heare of
263.   to be against hym or any of them. And I doe further sweare, That I
264.   doe from my heart abhor, detest and abjure as impious and hereticall
265.   this damnable Doctrine and Position, that Princes which be
266.   excōmunicated or deprived by the Pope may be deposed or murthered
267.   by theire Subjects or any other whosoever. And I doe beleeve and in
268.   my Conscience am resolved, that neither the Pope nor any pson
269.   whatsoever hath power to absolve me of this Oath or any parte
270.   therof, which I acknowledge by good and full Authoritye to be
271.   lawfully ministered unto mee, and doe renounce all Pardons and
272.   Dispensac̄ons to the contrarie; And all these things I do plainly
273.   and sincerely acknowledge and sweare, according to these expresse
274.   wordes by me spoken, and according to the playne and cōmon sense
275.   and understanding of the same wordes, without any equivocac̄on or
276.   mentall evasion or secret reservac̄on whatsoever; And I doe make
277.   this recognic̄on and acknowledgment heartily willingly and truly
278.   upon the true Faithe of a Christian: So help me God. Unto which Oath
279.   so taken, the saide pson shall subscribe his or her Name or Marke.
280.   [1605.]
281. 
282. Both of these Oaths were commanded during the reign of Charles the
283. First, 1625–1649.
284. 
285. By the third Charter of the Virginia Company, their Treasurer, or any
286. two of the Council, were empowered to administer the Oaths of Supremacy,
287. and of Allegiance, to all persons going to their Colony. And the
288. Pilgrims, through their chief men, agreed with the Virginia Company:
289. “The Oath of Supremacy we shall willingly take, if it be required of us,
290. if that convenient satisfaction be not given by our taking the Oath of
291. Allegiance. John Robinson. William Brewster.”
292. 
293. The Charter of the Massachusetts-Bay Company gave them broader powers in
294. that it did not exact this provision from them but gave the Company
295. liberty to admit new members, called “Freemen” of the Company, and no
296. method, conditions, or qualifications were presented for conferring this
297. privilege. Their leaders, as we shall see, were quick to take advantage
298. of the opportunity given them to frame their own Oaths of citizenship.
299. Too late the government in England, or rather that part which was
300. representative of the Church of England, realized the powers of
301. colonization this gave the dissenting churchmen; and, in 1637, a
302. Proclamation was issued, aimed principally to prevent the emigration of
303. Puritan Ministers, which commanded that none should be suffered to go to
304. New England “without a certificate that they had taken the Oaths of
305. Supremacy and Allegiance, and had conformed to the discipline of the
306. Church of England.” In 1638, another Proclamation “commanded owners and
307. masters of vessels that they do not fit out any with passengers and
308. provisions to New-England, without license from the Commissioners of
309. Plantations.”
310. 
311. Another Oath, drawn up in England, also claims a place here because it
312. was sometimes voluntarily taken by settlers in the New England Colonies.
313. In the year 1655, during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, an Oath,
314. probably similar to that prescribed by the Rump Parliament to the
315. Council of State, was enacted which was known as:
316. 
317. 
318.                          THE OATH OF ABJURATION
319. 
320.   I do hereby swear that I do renounce the pretended title of Charles
321.   Stuart, and the whole line of the late King James; and of any other
322.   person, as a single person pretending, or which shall pretend to the
323.   crown or government of these nations of England Scotland and
324.   Ireland, or any of them; and that I will, by the grace and
325.   assistance of Almighty God, be true, faithful and constant to the
326.   Parliament, and Commonwealth; and will oppose the bringing in, or
327.   setting up any single person or House of Lords, and every
328.   of them, in this Commonwealth.
329. 
330. Soon after the Restoration, Charles the Second, by Proclamation
331. commanded that the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance be tendered to all
332. persons disaffected to the Government and, in case of refusal, that they
333. were to be prosecuted under the Statute of the 7th of James. During the
334. reign of his Roman Catholic successor, James the Second, the Oath of
335. Supremacy was allowed to lapse, and the Oath of Allegiance, only, was in
336. full force in the Colonies, up to the publication of his declaration of
337. liberty of conscience for all denominations in England and Scotland, in
338. 1687–1688, which sealed his doom.
339. 
340. These preliminaries are necessary to a full understanding of our subject
341. which naturally begins, in point of time, with the settlement
342. 
343. 
344. 
345. 
346. _In New Plymouth Colony._
347. 
348. 
349. Strictly speaking, Plymouth was not a New England Colony. It was without
350. a Charter, and the functions of its government were those of a
351. Corporation. The power of the Oath of Allegiance their leaders had
352. assented to always seemed to hang over them, and paralyze the initiative
353. they should have taken. Their attempts to increase their circumscribed
354. boundaries at New Plymouth were futile; and, in the case of their
355. attempted settlement in Maine, disastrous both to the business
356. reputation of their leaders, and to the Corporation. They could spare
357. neither the men nor the means from the parent settlement to form
358. permanent settlements elsewhere. They seemed doomed to failure. And yet
359. hardly that, when we consider the impress upon our Nation made by their
360. sterling qualities of mind and heart, their patience and fortitude under
361. severe trials, the hopes and ambition of their teachings, and their
362. never-failing trust in God’s Providence. These high qualities still
363. animate and live in the great and growing number who proudly claim their
364. ancestry from the Pilgrims at New Plymouth.
365. 
366. 
367.                 COMBINATION FOR FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT
368.                                 known as
369.                          THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT
370. 
371.   In y^e name of God, Amen. We whose names are underwriten, the loyall
372.   subjects of our dread soveraigne Lord, King James, by y^e grace of
373.   God, of Great Britaine, Franc, & Ireland, king, defender of y^e

377.   of Virginia, doe by these presents solemnly & mutualy in y^e
378.   presence of God, and one of another, covenant & combine our selves
379.   togeather into a civill body politick, for our better ordering &
380.   preservation & furtherance of y^e ends aforesaid; and by vertue
381.   hearof to enacte, constitute, and frame such just & equall lawes,
382.   ordinances, acts, constitutions, & offices, from time to time, as
383.   shall be thought most meete & convenient for y^e generall good of
384.   y^e Colonie, unto which we promise all due submission and obedience.
385.   In witnes wherof we have hereunder subscribed our names at Cap-Codd
386.   y^e 11 of November, in y^e year of y^e raigne of our soveraigne
387.   lord, King James, of England, France, & Ireland y^e eighteenth, and
388.   of Scotland y^e fiftie fourth. An^o: Dom. 1620. [Forty-one names.]
389. 
390. The Mayflower Compact has received full and adequate treatment in the
391. paper read before this Society in October, 1920, by Arthur Lord, LL.D.
392. 
393. The exact date of the two forms of Oaths first given has not been
394. determined, but they are certainly later than the formation of the first
395. Council in 1624.
396. 
397. 
398.                     OATH OF ALLEGIANCE AND FIDELITY
399. 
400.   The forme of Oath ... which liue in this Colonie ... the Oth of
401.   alegance to his maj ... fidelity to the same.
402. 
403.   You shall sweare by the name of the Great God ... & earth & in his

405.   aduise, anything or things, acte or acts, directly, or indirectly,
406.   By land, or water, that doth, shall, or may, tend to the destruction
407.   or ouerthrowe of this present plantation, Colonie, or Corporation of
408.   this towne Plimouth in New England.
409. 
410.   Neither shall you suffer the same to be spoken, or done, but shall
411.   hinder, & oposse the same, by all due means you can.
412. 
413.   You shall not enter into any league, treaty, Confederac̄ or
414.   combination, with any, within the said Colonie or without the same
415.   that shall plote, or contriue any thing to the hurte, & ruine of the
416.   growth, and good of the said plantation.
417. 
418.   You shall not consente to any shuch confederation, nor conceale any
419.   known vnto you certainly, or by conje but shall forthwith manifest &
420.   make knowne the same, to the Gouernours of this said towne for the
421.   time being.
422. 
423.   And this you promise & swear, simply, & truly, & faithfully to

425.   truth & punisher of falshoode.]
426. 
427.   The forme of the Oath which ... of the Gouernour, & Counsell at

434.   plantation, to the vtmost of your power; and oppose any thing that
435.   may hinder the same. So help you God.
436. 
437. The words, “a true Christian” were afterwards crossed out, and the form
438. used later: “as you hope for help from God, the God of truth and
439. punisher of falsehood” was substituted.
440. 
441. By the Laws of 1636, every freeman was required to take the following
442. Oath:
443. 
444. 
445.                          THE OATH OF A FFREEMAN
446. 
447.   You shall be truly loyall to our Sov Lord King Charles, his heires &
448.   successors, [the State & Govern^t of England as it now stands.] You
449.   shall not speake or doe, devise or advise any thing or things act or
450.   acts directly or indirectly by land or water, that doth shall or may
451.   tend to the destrucc̄on or overthrow of this pr̄nt plantac̄ons
452.   Colonies or Corporac̄on of New Plymouth, Neither shall you suffer
453.   the same to be spoken or done but shall hinder oppose & discover the
454.   same to the Govr̄ & Assistants of the said Colony for the time being
455.   or some one of them. You shall faithfully submit unto such good &
456.   wholesome laws & ordnanc & as either are or shall be made for the
457.   ordering & governm^t of the same, and shall endeavor to advance the
458.   growth & good of the severall Colonies plantations w^{th} in the
459.   limit & of this Corporac̄on by all due meanes & courses. All w^{ch}
460.   you promise & sweare by the name of the great God of heaven & earth
461.   simply truly & faithfully to pforme as you hope for help frō God
462.   who is the God of truth & punisher of falsehood. [1636]
463. 
464. Following the outbreak of civil war in England in 1638, the words “our
465. sovereign lord King Charles his heirs and successors” were erased, and
466. loyalty to “the State and Government of England as it now stands”
467. substituted. The modern rendering intermixed is probably an attempt by
468. the transcriber to fill out missing or undecipherable paragraphs or
469. sentences.
470. 
471. According to Francis Baylies’ “Historical Memoir of New Plymouth,” (I:
472. 235,) the following Oath was prescribed to be taken by any residing in
473. the government of New Plymouth:
474. 
475. 
476.                          THE OATH OF A RESIDENT
477. 
478.   You shall be truly loyal to our sovereign lord King Charles, his
479.   heirs and successors, and whereas you choose at present to reside
480.   within the government of New Plymouth, you shall not do or cause to
481.   be done any act or acts directly or indirectly, by land or water,
482.   that shall tend to the destruction or overthrow of the whole or any
483.   of the several plantations or townships within the said government
484.   that are or shall be orderly erected or established, but shall
485.   contrariwise hinder, oppose, and discover the same, and such intents
486.   and purposes as tend thereunto, to the Governor for the time being,
487.   or some one of the assistants with all convenient speed. You shall
488.   also submit unto and obey all such good and wholesome laws,
489.   ordinances, and offices as are or shall be established within the
490.   limits thereof. So help you God. [1636.]
491. 
492. The disturbed state of England is also reflected in the 1658 revision of
493. the Laws when “our sovereign lord the King, his heirs and successors” is
494. substituted for “the present State and Government of England,” as
495. follows:
496. 
497. 
498.                          THE OATH OF A FFREEMAN
499. 
500.   You shalbee truely Loyall to the present State and Goūment of
501.   England [our Sou^r Lord the King his heires and Successors.] You
502.   shall not speake or doe deuise or aduise Any thinge or thinges Acte
503.   or Actes directly or Indirectly by Land or Water that doth shall or
504.   may tend to the destruction or ouerthrow of these present
505.   plantations or Townshipes of the Corporation of New Plymouth neither
506.   shall you suffer the same to bee spoken or done but shall hinder
507.   oppose and discouer the same to the Gou^r And Assistants of the said
508.   Collonie for the time being; or some one of them; you shall
509.   faithfully submitt vnto such good and wholesome Lawes and ordinances
510.   as either are or shalbee made for the ordering and Gou^rment of the
511.   same; and shall Indeuor to aduance the grouth and good of the
512.   seuerall townshipes and plantations within the Lymetts of this
513.   Corporation by all due meanes and courses; All which you pmise and
514.   Sweare by the Name of the great God of heauen and earth simply
515.   truely and faithfully to pforme as you hope for healp from God who
516.   is the God of truth and the punisher of falchood. [1658.]
517. 
518. At the time of the 1671 revision of the Laws, Charles the Second had
519. been firmly seated on the English throne for ten years, but his name is
520. omitted from the superscription of the following Oath. The intensity of
521. the feeling in the New England Colonies towards even the name of the two
522. kings is shown in the fact that until after the middle of the next
523. century Harvard College had only three graduates, if the three Charles
524. Chaunceys, with whom it was a family name in England, are omitted, and
525. Yale College only one graduate who bore the Christian name of Charles.
526. 
527. 
528.                          THE OATH OF A FFREEMAN
529. 
530.   You shalbee truely Loyall to our Sou^r Lord the Kinge his heires and
531.   Successors; you shall not doe nor speake deuise or aduise any thinge
532.   or thinges act or actes directly or Inderectly by Land or water;
533.   that shall or may tend to the destruction or ouerthrow of any of
534.   these plantations or towneshipes of the Corporation of New Plymouth;
535.   neither shall you suffer the same to bee spoken or done but shall
536.   hinder oppose and discouer the same to the Gou^r and Assistants of
537.   the said Collonie for the time being or some one of them; you shall
538.   faithfully submitt vnto such good and wholesome lawes and
539.   ordinances; as either are or shalbee made for the ordering and
540.   Gou^rment of the same; and shall endeauor to advance the good and
541.   grouth of the seuerall Towneshipes and plantations within the
542.   Lymetts of this Corporation by all due meanes and courses; all which
543.   you p^rmise and sweare by the Name of the great God of heauen and
544.   earth simply truely and faithfully to pforme as you hope for healpe
545.   from God whoe is the God of truth and the punisher of ffalchood.

551. _In Massachusetts-Bay Colony._
552. 
553. 
554. When on the 4th of March 1628/9, Charles, “by the grace of God, Kinge of
555. England, Scotland, Fraunce, and Ireland, Defender of the Fayth, &c. in
556. the fourth yeare of our raigne” did by letters patent grant unto Sir
557. Henry Rosewell and his twenty-five associates, their heirs and assigns
558. forever, all that certain part of the grant of New England which his
559. “deare and royall father, Kinge James of blessed memory ... hath given
560. and graunted vnto the Counsell established at Plymouth in the County of
561. Devon” and which the said Council by deed dated the 19th of March,
562. 1627/8, had “given, graunted, bargained, soulde, enfeoffed, aliened and
563. confirmed” to Sir Henry Rosewell, Sir John Young, Knightes, Thomas
564. Southcott, John Humphrey, John Endecott and Symon Whetcombe, their heirs
565. and associates forever, “To be houlden of vs our heires and successors,
566. as of our manor of Eastgreenewich, in the County of Kent, within our
567. realme of England,” under the name of the “Governor and Company of the
568. Mattachusetts Bay in Newe England, one bodie politique and corporate in
569. deede, fact, and name, ... and that by that name they shall have
570. perpetuall succession,”—may acquire lands, &c. have a common seal; and
571. that there shall be one Governor, one Deputy Governor, and eighteen
572. assistants to be chosen out of the freemen. He went farther, and
573. constituted “our welbeloved Mathewe Cradocke to be the first and present
574. Governor; Thomas Goffe to be Deputy Governor, and eighteen of the other
575. associates to be Assistants, who before they undertake the execution of
576. their offices and places shall respectively take their corporal oaths
577. for the faithful performance of their duties.” The Oath for Matthew
578. Craddock, as Governor, to be administered by a Master of the Chancery,
579. the Governor was then empowered to administer the oaths to the Deputy
580. Governor and Assistants nominated in the Charter. Oaths to subsequent
581. officers being arranged: the new Governor to take the Oath before the
582. old Deputy Governor, or two Assistants; and the new Deputy Governor,
583. Assistants and all other officers hereafter chosen to take the oath
584. before the Governor for the time being. They were empowered to transport
585. any of our loving subjects, or any strangers willing to become our
586. loving subjects, and any seven at least of their number had “full power
587. and authoritie to choose, nominate, and appointe such and soe many
588. others as they shall thinke fitt, and that shall be willing to accept
589. the same, to be free of the said Company and Body, and Them into the
590. same to admitt.” All subjects inhabiting the lands granted, and their
591. children “which shall happen to be borne there, or on the seas in goeing
592. thither, or retorning from thence shall have and enjoy all liberties and
593. immunities of free and natural subjects, ... as yf they and everie of
594. them were borne within the realme of England.” And the Governor and
595. Deputy Governor, and any two or more of the Assistants, at any of their
596. Courts or Assemblys shall and may at all times have full power to give
597. the Oath of Office and Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, or either of
598. them, to every person who may go to New England to inhabit in the same.
599. They were also authorized to make “the formes of such Oathes warrantable
600. by the lawes and statutes of this our realme of England as shalbe
601. respectivelie ministered vnto them, for the execuc̄on of the said
602. severall offices and places ... and ministring the said oathes to the
603. newe elected officers.”
604. 
605. At the end of the Charter appeared the Oath of Governor:
606. 
607.   PRÆDICT, Matthaeus Cradocke Juratus est de Fide et Obedientiâ Regi
608.   et Successoribus suis, et de Debitâ Exequutione Officij Gubernatoris
609.   iuxta Tenorem P^r sentium, 18^o Martij, 1628. Coram me, Carola
610.   Cæsare, Milite, in Cancellariâ Mr̃o.
611. 
612.                                                           Char. Cæsar.
613. 
614. By this Charter, under the privy seal of Cardinal Wolseley, was,
615. unwittingly, planted the seed of the fairest flower that ever bloomed in
616. the garden of colonization since Eden.
617. 
618. Up to August, 1630, the business of the Massachusetts-Bay Company was
619. transacted in London. But the business of the Massachusetts-Bay Colony
620. may be said to have really begun in May, 1631.
621. 
622. At “A Gen^rall Court holden att Boston, the 18th day of May, 1631. John
623. Winthrop, Esq̃ was chosen Goun^r for a whole yeare nexte ensueinge by
624. the gen^rall consent of the Court, according to the meaneing of the
625. pattent, and did accordingly take an oathe to the place of Goun̄^r
626. belonginge.”
627. 
628. “Tho: Dudley, Esq̃, is also chosen Deputy Gouñ^r for this yeare nexte
629. ensuing, & did in p^rsence of the Court take an oath to his place
630. belonginge.” And “to the end the body of the com̄ons may be p^rserued of
631. honest & good men, it was likewise ordered and agreed that for time to
632. come noe man shalbe admitted to the freedome of this body polliticke,
633. but such as are members of some of the churches within the lymitts of
634. the same.”
635. 
636. The Law that all freemen must be church members, while assented to in
637. Salem in 1631, was modified in 1632, probably for local reasons, that no
638. civil magistrate could be an elder in the church.
639. 
640. To give force to this law an Oath of Freemen was required, and this
641. service the newly appointed Governor and the Deputy Governor elected to
642. perform. The result of their labors, the original draft of the Oath of a
643. Freeman, in the handwriting of the first and greatest of the Governors
644. of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Oath of a Servant, in the
645. handwriting of the second Governor—a document perhaps only surpassed in
646. historical interest and importance by, and worthy to rank with, the
647. Declaration of Independence—is now, appropriately, in the possession of
648. the Public Library of the City of Boston, and its preservation assured.
649. 
650. Through the courtesy of the Trustees, this Society is permitted again to
651. give publicity to the excellent facsimiles of these interesting
652. documents, together with transcriptions of the somewhat obscure
653. handwriting, with interlineations and cancelled words showing, line for
654. line, the changes made by the authors, which first appeared in the
655. _Bulletin_ of the Library for July, 1894.

660.   I, A. B. &c. being, by the Almighties most wise disposic̄on, become

838.   It was agreed & ordered, that the former oath of ffreemen shalbe
839.   revoked, soe farr as it is dissonant from the oath of ffreemen
840.   herevnder written, & that those that receaved the former oath shall

846. 
847.   I, A. B., being, by Gods providence, an inhabitant & ffreeman within
848.   the jurisdicc̄on of this com̄onweale, doe freely acknowledge my
849.   selfe to be subiect to the goverm^t thereof, & therefore doe heere

859.   the speedy preventing thereof. Moreouer, I doe solemnely binde

877. The text of the Oath given above is that given in the body of the Colony
878. Records, in the handwriting of Simon Bradstreet, the Secretary, and
879. differs only in the spelling of words from that of the transcriber (who

885.                          THE OATH OF A FREE-MAN
886. 
887.   I (A. B.) being by Gods providence an Inhabitant, and Freeman,
888.   within the Jurisdiction of this Commonwealth; do freely acknowledge
889.   my self to be subject to the Government thereof: And therefore do
890.   here swear by the great and dreadful Name of the Ever-living God,
891.   that _I_ will be true and faithfull to the same, and will
892.   accordingly yield assistance & support thereunto, with my person and
893.   estate, as in equity _I_ am bound; and will also truly endeavour to
894.   maintain and preserve all the liberties and priviledges thereof,
895.   submitting my self to the wholesome Lawes & Orders made and
896.   established by the same. And further that _I_ will not plot or
897.   practice any evill against it, or consent to any that shall so do;
898.   but will timely discover and reveal the same to lawfull Authority
899.   now here established, for the speedy preventing thereof. Moreover,
900.   _I_ doe solemnly bind my self in the sight of God, that when _I_
901.   shal be called to give my voyce touching any such matter of this
902.   State, in which Freemen are to deal, _I_ will give my vote and
903.   suffrage as _I_ shall judge in mine own conscience may best conduce
904.   and tend to the publike weal of the body, without respect of
905.   persons, or favour of any man. So help me God in the Lord Jesus
906.   Christ. [1634.] From the copy given in John Childe’s “New-Englands
907.   Jonas cast up at London.” (London, 1647), which the preface states
908.   was printed in Massachusetts-Bay, by itself.
909. 
910. To this form of The Oath of a Free man attaches the great additional
911. interest of being the first work printed in the United States of
912. America.
913. 
914. Under date of Mo. 1. (March, 1638/9) John Winthrop’s Journal states: “A
915. printing house was begun at Cambridge by one Daye, at the charge of Mr.
916. Glover, who died on sea hitherward. The first thing which was printed
917. was the freemen’s oath; the next was an almanac made for New England by
918. Mr. William Peirce, mariner; the next was the Psalms newly turned into
919. metre.”
920. 
921. For nearly three hundred years no copy of this printed paper has been
922. known to be extant. The ceaseless search for a copy in this country by
923. antiquarians, bibliographers and historians would long ago have been
924. successful, if even a single copy had been preserved in either the
925. institutions of the State, or Nation, or in individual or family
926. possession.
927. 
928. It would be difficult to exaggerate the patriotic feeling of our people,
929. if it were known that a copy of this interesting and valuable state
930. paper, the first fruit of the printing-press in this country, whose
931. ringing sentences of freedom preceded by nearly a century and a half the
932. Declaration of Independence, had been discovered at this late day.
933. 
934. Fully a quarter of a century ago, while engaged in making a search for
935. early printed American publications in the Catalogue of printed books in
936. the British Museum—a great and monumental work, worthy in its scholarly
937. completeness of the Government which fostered its publication, and of
938. inestimable importance and benefit to scholars in every land—the
939. following entry under the heading “Freeman” seemed to me to warrant more
940. than passing observation and curiosity which the intervening years have
941. failed to satisfy:
942. 
943.                      —The Oath of a Freeman. B. L.
944.           [_London_, 1645?] _s. sh._ 12º. 11,626. aa. (1, 2.)
945. 
946. An analysis of this entry seems to show points of resemblance following
947. closely the known facts regarding the first work printed in this
948. country.
949. 
950. The title is the one given by John Childe presumably from the earliest
951. printed copy in his possession. The abbreviated title, freemen’s oath,
952. as given by John Winthrop, first appearing in the Code of 1648, which
953. seems to justify the belief that Winthrop wrote his Journal some years
954. after the press was established.
955. 
956. The letters B. L. indicate that the printed text is in black-letter.
957. While there is no evidence of the number and kinds of fonts of type
958. purchased for the first press by Joseph Glover, there is an itemized
959. statement of the number and names of the fonts of type for the second
960. press sent over later by the Society for Propagating the Gospel among
961. the Indians in New England, for printing the Bible in the Indian
962. language, and among them is a small font of “blacks,” i.e. black-letter,
963. which would indicate that a small font of that letter was generally
964. considered a part of the equipment of a printing-office of the period.
965. Even if this was not so, on the good authority of Isaiah Thomas, the
966. type used in printing the Bay Psalm Book, of 1640, was “small bodied
967. English,” a type commonly used for works in quarto and folio, which
968. approximates in size to black-letter, but without the ceriphs, or fine
969. projecting points of that letter. It is not unreasonable to suppose that
970. a cataloguer might, hastily, consider the thickly inked, heavy
971. press-work we find in the Bay Psalm Book, under the same conditions in a
972. somewhat crudely printed sheet, to be black-letter printing.
973. 
974. The brackets enclosing the imprint indicate that the place and date
975. given do not appear on the printed sheet, but are the personal judgment
976. of the cataloguer regarding them. Having already determined the printing
977. to be in black-letter English, it naturally follows in his judgment that
978. the place of printing is London. His guess of the year, 1645, which he
979. queries, is a close one; but is open to the criticism that an Oath of a
980. Freeman could never have been printed or exacted in England during the
981. reign of Charles the First. Ten years later, under Cromwellian rule, it
982. might have been done. But the only place on earth it could have been
983. printed and exacted without imprisonment, in 1645, was in the freemen’s
984. Colony of Massachusetts-Bay.
985. 
986. In this connection it may be well to observe, as a further illustration
987. that Governor Winthrop wrote his Journal years later than the events he
988. records, that his date of 1638/9, should be one year later, for the date
989. of the half-sheet almanac by William Peirce, mariner. Following
990. Winthrop, if the almanac was calculated for the year beginning in March,
991. 1639, it would suppose its printing sometime before the 25th of March,
992. or in the Julian year 1638. This would leave nearly a whole year during
993. which no other printing was done. If the almanac was calculated for the
994. year beginning in March, 1640—the year the Bay Psalm Book is dated—then
995. it would suppose the Oath, and the Almanac, printed in the eleventh or
996. twelfth months of the Julian year 1639, which is more probable. Isaiah
997. Thomas, writing in 1810, leaves this question in doubt by not stating
998. whether his January, 1639, refers to the Julian, or the Gregorian
999. Calendar.
1000. 
1001. To continue our analysis: The format, and size, agrees with the known
1002. facts that the Oath was printed “on the face of a half sheet of small
1003. paper.” The shelf-mark indicates the permanent place on the shelves of
1004. the Library.
1005. 
1006. The singular appearance of the only known copy of this important and
1007. interesting document in the Colonial history of New England, nearly
1008. three hundred years after its printing, so far from its place of
1009. publication, calls for explanation, which is apparently furnished in a
1010. work published in London, in April, 1647, entitled: “New-Englands Jonas
1011. cast up at London.” On the title-page it purports to be written by Major
1012. John Childe, a brother of Doctor Robert Childe, of Hingham, who was
1013. detained by order of the General Court of Massachusetts-Bay; but
1014. according to William Hubbard, in his History, and affirmed by John
1015. Winthrop, in his Journal, the real author of everything, except the
1016. Preface, was William Vassall.

1042. Its odd title was suggested by a remark made by the Reverend John
1043. Cotton, in a Thursday-Lecture, preached November 5, 1646, just previous
1044. to the departure of the vessel which was carrying back to England some
1045. of the dissatisfied signers of a Petition to the General Court, who
1046. rumor gave were taking with them this and other incriminating documents
1047. against the Government of the Colony. The learned preacher took for his
1048. text, Canticles, II: 15. “Take us the foxes, the little foxes, which
1049. destroy the vines,” and made pointed allusions to the current rumors,
1050. and the punishment which their acts would receive in a stormy voyage,
1051. and how it could be averted. But later we shall let Vassall tell the
1052. story in his own words. The effect upon his hearers was so great that
1053. some who had engaged passage withdrew rather than risk the dangers of a
1054. stormy voyage in the winter season.
1055. 
1056. After a brief summary of the reasons for publication the Preface states
1057. that the Relation is made up of the following particulars:
1058. 
1059.   First, the Petition of the greater part of the Inhabitants of
1060.   Hingham, and the proceedings therein.
1061. 
1062.   Secondly, a Petition of Doctor Child and others delivered to the
1063.   General Court at Boston with some passages thereon.
1064. 
1065.   Thirdly, the Capital Laws of the Massachusetts Bay, with the
1066.   Freemans Oath, _as they are printed there by themselves_.
1067. 
1068. The italics are mine. Here, then, we have direct proof confirming the
1069. statement of John Winthrop that the Freeman’s Oath was printed at
1070. Cambridge in 1639, and, in the body of the work, is given the full text
1071. of The Oath of a Free man as printed. It is probable that only the
1072. number of copies necessary for officials authorized to administer the
1073. Oath were printed, and the copy taken to England was surreptitiously
1074. obtained from some member of the Government. Its importance lay in the
1075. fact that it afforded printed evidence that nowhere in it is any
1076. reference made to the King’s Majesty, or of allegiance to any power on
1077. earth save that of their own Government as constituted.
1078.

1086. 
1087. The Capital Laws were printed at Cambridge in 1642, probably under the
1088. same restriction, as to number; and, as printed evidence, open to the
1089. same construction as the Oath. Whatever the purpose, however, it had
1090. been forestalled some four years earlier when the Capital Laws were
1091. re-printed in London in a folio broadside. The copy in the British
1092. Museum bears the Colophon: “Printed first in New-England, and re-printed
1093. in London for Ben. Allen in Popes-Head Allen [_sic_] 1643.”
1094. 
1095.   Fourthly, a relation of that story of Jonas verbatim as it was
1096.   delivered to me in writing by a Gentleman that was then a passenger
1097.   in the ship.
1098. 
1099.   “When the first ship that came this year 1646 from New-England, was
1100.   almost ready to come from thence; Mr. Cotton in his Thursday-Lecture
1101.   at Boston, preached out of that Scripture, Cant. 2, 15. Take us the
1102.   little Foxes, &c. In his uses took occasion to say, That if any
1103.   shall carry any Writings, Complaints against the people of God in
1104.   that Country it would be a Jonas in the ship. * * He also advised
1105.   the Ship-Master, that if storms did arise, to search if they had not
1106.   in any Chest or Trunk any such Jonas aboard, which if you find (said
1107.   he) I do not advise you to throw the persons over-board, but the
1108.   Writings; or words to that effect. Whereupon, having great storms
1109.   (as could not be otherwise expected) some of the Passengers
1110.   remembering Mr. Cotton’s Sermon, it seems were much affected with
1111.   what he had said; and a woman amongst them came up from between the
1112.   decks about Midnight, or after, in a distracted passionate manner to
1113.   Mr. William Vassall who lay in the great Cabin, but for the present
1114.   was in the Sterage-door-way looking abroad: she earnestly desired
1115.   him, if there were any Jonas in the ship, that as Mr. Cotton had
1116.   directed it might be thrown over-board, with many broken expressions
1117.   to that purpose. He asked her why she came to him? and she said
1118.   because it was thought that he had some Writings against the people
1119.   of God: but he answered her, He had nothing but a Petition to the
1120.   Parliament that they might enjoy the liberty of English subjects,
1121.   and that could be no Jonas; and that if the best of New-Englands
1122.   friends could shew him any evil in that, he would not prefer it.
1123.   After this she went into the great Cabin to Mr. Tho. Fowle in like
1124.   distracted manner; who told her he had nothing but the Copy of
1125.   Petition which himself and others had presented to the Court at
1126.   Boston; and showed, and read it to her, and then told her, That if
1127.   she and others thought that to be the cause of the storm, she and
1128.   they might do what they would with it; but he professed that he saw
1129.   no evil in it, neither was his Conscience troubled with it. So she
1130.   took it and carried it between Decks to them from whom she came, and
1131.   they agreed to throw it over-board and it was thrown over-board: but
1132.   the storm did not leave us upon the throwing of the Paper over-board
1133.   as it is reported; for they had many great storms after that; much
1134.   lesse was the great and wonderfull deliverance which by Gods mercy
1135.   he gave unto them from shipwrack and drowning at the Isles of Silly,
1136.   upon the throwing of that Writing over-board; for that was thrown
1137.   over long before, at least 14 dayes. Also the error is the more in
1138.   this, That the report is that it was the petition to the Parliament
1139.   that was thrown over-board; and it was only a Copy of a Petition to
1140.   their own Court at Boston, and the Petition to the Parliament was
1141.   still in the ship, together with another copy of that which was
1142.   thrown over-board, and other writings of that nature, some of which
1143.   are printed in this book, and were as well saved as their lives and
1144.   other goods, and are here in London to be seen and made use of in
1145.   convenient time.”
1146. 
1147. It is true that at any time in the intervening years of a quarter of a
1148. century I could have written to the British Museum authorities and been
1149. sure of a courteous reply; but the matter seemed too important to be
1150. settled in so prosaic a way. This, and the hope that sometime I might be
1151. able to determine the matter personally, and achieve the honor that
1152. would attach to its discovery, deterred me.
1153. 
1154. I suppose that men of all professions, in their callings, feel an
1155. unwonted glow in the achievement of some object; but I know of no
1156. greater joy than that which fills the lover of books when his long
1157. search for a rare book is rewarded. Then it is that you seem to enter
1158. into the holy of holies of delight, when the whole body thrills with
1159. suppressed emotions, the eyes moisten, and the trembling hand stretched
1160. out to take the volume does so with a touch which is almost a caress.
1161. The feeling, I think, must be somewhat akin to the “buck fever” of the
1162. deer hunter, whose mind and shaking limbs refuse to function, as he
1163. looks into the luminous eyes, and notes the startled look, and graceful
1164. beauty of his prey, until it has bounded into safety in the forest. Why,
1165. I reasoned with myself, should I give to another the pleasure of these
1166. emotions which were mine by right of discovery.
1167. 
1168. The opportunity of voyaging to England, which I had so long looked
1169. forward to, did not come to me until the Spring of the present year, and
1170. the pleasant anticipations with which I set out were comparable in my
1171. own mind with those which must have animated the Knights of Arthur’s
1172. Round Table in their quest for the holy grail. The morning after my
1173. arrival in London found me an early visitor at the British Museum. The
1174. preliminaries of admittance to the Reading-Room are not difficult, and
1175. are soon over with, and I found myself within the great rotunda, its
1176. walls lined in tiers with what is best in the literatures of the world,
1177. and from which has gone out so much that is worth while in English
1178. literature. From the Catalogue I filled out slips for some half dozen
1179. works, artfully to conceal the one uppermost in my mind, handed them in
1180. at the desk, and returned to my chosen seat to await with such calmness
1181. as I could command the culmination of years of desire. Heeding the
1182. legend that when the grail was approached by any one not perfectly pure
1183. it vanished from sight; and that to be qualified to discover it one must
1184. be perfectly chaste in thought and act, I endeavored to prepare myself
1185. for its appearance. Somewhere I have read of an Oriental visionary who
1186. attained a high degree of saintly perfection by fixing his gaze
1187. steadfastly for hours upon his navel, which a growing embonpoint made an
1188. easy thing to do, and I sought for holiness in the same way.
1189. 
1190. In time the white slips of my wants came fluttering back to me by
1191. messengers, all marked, very properly for security on account of rarity,
1192. that they could only be consulted in the North Library, until all were
1193. in but the one most desired. Then followed a much longer wait and
1194. then—the slip was handed back to me with a notation that I had given a
1195. wrong shelf-mark! Gone in an instant were all the perfectly pure and
1196. chaste thoughts with which I had been regaling myself while I was
1197. apparently looking at the wrong button on my vest. I think I could have
1198. stood the blow better if it had been that hoary old fiction of careless
1199. assistants that it was “out”, but this is a boon denied to any assistant
1200. in the British Museum, where nothing is allowed to go out. A comparison
1201. with the printed Catalogue showed an exact correspondence, and I sought
1202. the Superintendent of the Reading-Room, who assured me that the matter
1203. would have his personal attention; and for the rest of the day I busied
1204. myself with my other wants in the North Library without any word of the
1205. missing broadside reaching me. That evening, in communion with myself, I
1206. determined to throw off the mask of secrecy and frankly confide the
1207. importance of my quest to the Keeper of the Printed Books—the somewhat
1208. expressive and imposing title of the Librarian of the British Museum.
1209. 
1210. Before calling upon him I sought as an introducer Henry N. Stevens—the
1211. worthy son of an illustrious father who follows closely in his footsteps
1212. as the best authority on early printed American books in Europe—at his
1213. shop across the street from the imposing Museum building, and to him I
1214. told my story. As I proceeded his interest grew, and before I had
1215. finished he excitedly grasped my arm with one hand and his hat with the
1216. other, exclaiming: “Come with me. This is not a subject for underlings,”
1217. and rushed me across the street without pause until we were in the
1218. sanctum sanctorum of the learned and accomplished Keeper, Alfred W.
1219. Pollard. And to him I told my simple tale, and asked his assistance. Mr.
1220. Pollard is himself a bibliographer of note in his special field, and my
1221. story was not without interest to him, but he refused to share my belief
1222. that the missing broadside was what I supposed it to be, laying much
1223. stress upon the black-letter feature as proof of its English origin. The
1224. unsuccessful search for the missing broadside had evidently been called
1225. to his notice, and the failure to produce anything in the millions of
1226. books catalogued in that vast collection, he considered a challenge to
1227. the efficiency of himself and his staff of assistants. A few days later,
1228. he acknowledged failure; but gave me the interesting information that in
1229. tracing the broadside back to its accession he had found that it was
1230. acquired by the Museum in the year 1865, and formed part of a bundle of
1231. miscellaneous matter, being considered of so little importance as not
1232. even to have been mentioned in the contents of the bundle. Printing of
1233. the letter F of the Catalogue was completed in 1888, and since that time
1234. an expansion of the classification of books upon the shelves had been
1235. made, from which dated its disappearance. He would not, however,
1236. discontinue his efforts to find it. After apologizing for giving him a
1237. “bad half-hour,” which only the importance of the broadside excused, our
1238. second interview ended. On my last day in London, I went again with Mr.
1239. Stevens to call on Mr. Pollard about the matter, and told him that I had
1240. made my arrangements to fly from London to Paris on the morrow, and
1241. asked him if these old eyes of mine were never to behold the holy grail.
1242. “In black-letter?” he queried, touching the weak spot in my armor. “In
1243. duodecimo!” I countered, pointing to the rent in his own. And the third
1244. interview ended with his assurance that the search would go on until the
1245. missing broadside was found.
1246. 
1247. And there the matter rests, very much in the condition of the story of
1248. the cook who asked the skipper: “Is any thing lost when you know where
1249. it is?” And to the skipper’s gruff response, “Of course not,” he
1250. pleasantly replied: “I am glad to know that our only iron soup kettle
1251. wasn’t lost when it fell over-board into the Bay.”
1252. 
1253. Through the courtesy of our fellow-members, Henry Edwards Huntington,
1254. Esquire, and the accomplished bibliographer and librarian of his
1255. unrivaled collection of books and art, George Watson Cole, the Society
1256. is permitted to give a reproduction from the only known copy of “The
1257. Book of General Lawes and Libertyes concerning the Inhabitants of the
1258. Massachusetts”—the long-lost Code of 1648. No copy or fragment of a copy
1259. was known to be extant for over two hundred and fifty years, when, in
1260. 1906, this copy was discovered in a small private library in England,
1261. and was sold to the late Edmund Dwight Church for the highest price ever
1262. paid for an American printed book—a record which is not likely to be
1263. surpassed. The almost miraculous recovery of this volume, will, I have
1264. given my reasons to hope, sometime have a counterpart in the recovery of
1265. the only known copy of the first work printed in the United States of
1266. America—The Oath of a Free man. From the year 1641, this bore the
1267. abbreviated title of the

1340. In 1643, the Colonies of Massachusetts-Bay, New Plymouth, Connecticut,
1341. and New Haven, concluded a Confederacy by which they entered into a
1342. solemn compact to afford each other mutual advice and assistance on all
1343. necessary occasions, whether offensive, defensive, or prudential. Among
1344. the reasons assigned for this Union were the dependent condition of the
1345. colonists; the vicinity of the French and Dutch, who were inclined to
1346. make encroachments; the warlike attitude of the neighboring Indians; the
1347. commencement of civil war in England, and impracticability of aid from
1348. thence in any emergency; and the sacred ties of religion which already
1349. bound them. The Province of Maine was not included because it was
1350. subject to rulers of Episcopal tenets, and was infrequently an asylum
1351. for excommunicants. This Union lasted for forty years without any
1352. general Oath of Allegiance being required from the inhabitants of the
1353. several Colonies.

1377.   Jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, do freely and sincerely
1378.   acknowledge my selfe to be subject to the Government thereof. And do

1390.   [1646.] From Code of 1660.
1391. 
1392.   _To the end the body of the freemen may be preserved of honest and
1393.   good men_, It is Ordered, That henceforth no man shall be admitted
1394.   to the freedome of this Common-wealth, but such as are members of
1395.   some of the Churches, within the limits of this Iurisdiction; _And
1396.   whereas many members of Churches to exempt themselves from Publick
1397.   Service, will not come in to be made freemen_, It is Ordered, That
1398.   no members of Churches within this Iurisidiction, shall be exempt
1399.   from any publick service, they shall be chosen to, by the
1400.   Inhabitants of the severall Townes, as Constables, Iurors, Select
1401.   men, surveiors of the High-wayes. And if any such person shall
1402.   refuse to serve in, or to take upon him any such Office, being
1403.   legally chosen therunto, he shall pay for every such refusall, such
1404.   fine, as the Town shall impose not exceeding _Twenty shillings_ for
1405.   one Offence. [1647.]
1406. 
1407.   Any non freemen, who have taken or shall take the Oath of fidelity
1408.   to this government could be jury men and vote in certain matters,
1409.   after he had attained the age of 24 years. [1647.]
1410. 
1411.   _For as much as divers Inhabitants of this Jurisdiction who have
1412.   long continued amongst us, receiving Protection, from this
1413.   Government, have as we are informed uttered Offencive speeches,
1414.   whereby their fidelity to this Government may justly be suspected,
1415.   and also that divers strangers of forreign parts do repaire to us of
1416.   whose fidelity we have not that Assurance which is Commonly required
1417.   of all Governments._
1418. 
1419.   It is therefore Ordered by this Court and the Authority thereof.
1420.   That the County Courts or any one Magistrate out of Court, shall
1421.   have power and is hereby Authorized to Require the Oath of fidelity
1422.   of all settled Inhabitants amongst us who have not already taken the
1423.   same, as also to Require the Oath under written, of all strangers,
1424.   who after two months have their abode here; And if any Person shall
1425.   refuse to take the Respective Oath, he or they shall be bound over
1426.   to the next County Court or Court of Assistants, where if he shall
1427.   refuse, he shall forfeit _five pound a week_ for every week he shall
1428.   Continue in this Jurisdiction after his sayd Refusall, unles he can
1429.   give sufficient security to the satisfaction of the Court or
1430.   Magistrate for his fidelity, during his or their residence amongst
1431.   us.

1434.                              STRANGERS OATH
1435. 
1436.   _You A. B. Do acknowledge your self subject to the Lawes of this
1437.   Jurisdiction during your Residence under this Government, and do
1438.   here Swear, by the Great Name of the Everliving GOD, and engage your
1439.   self to be true and faithfull to the same, and not to plot,
1440.   contrive, or conceal any thing that is to the hurt or detriment
1441.   thereof._ [1652.].
1442. 
1443. This was, apparently, aimed at the Quakers, whose offensive attitude
1444. towards the Government was made the subject of further drastic laws and
1445. orders by the General Court, in October, 1656, and May, 1658.
1446. 
1447.   _This Court having considered of the proposals presented to this
1448.   Court by several of the inhabitants of the County of Middlesex_; Do
1449.   Declare and Order, That no man whosoever, shall be admitted to the
1450.   Freedome of this Body Politick, but such as are members of some
1451.   Church of Christ and in full Communion, which they declare to be the
1452.   true intent of the ancient Law, _page the eighth of the second
1453.   Book_, Anno. 1631. [1660.]
1454. 
1455. This was construed as being directed against the members of the Church
1456. of England, and was largely responsible for the strained relations with
1457. his Majesty’s Commission in 1665. It was repealed before the 1672
1458. Revision of the Laws.
1459. 
1460. For causes already mentioned the publication of the first Code of Laws,
1461. in 1648, was unnoticed in England; but it was very different with the
1462. publication of the second Code, in 1660. When it appeared its provisions
1463. were subjected to critical scrutiny by enemies of the Puritan
1464. Commonwealth, and the worst possible constructions placed upon them. In
1465. particular, the loyalty of the framers, who took an Oath of Fidelity to
1466. their Government, and none to the King, was questioned; and the
1467. provisions for the admission of freemen which, practically, prohibited
1468. members of the Church of England. By letter, his Majesty ordered a
1469. redress of these grievances, and appointed a Commission who proceeded,
1470. in a partisan manner, to execute their powers. In 1665, the
1471. Commissioners presented to the General Court a list of twenty-six
1472. changes which they desired to have made in the Code of 1660. The
1473. principal ones were the substitution of an acknowledgment of the royal
1474. authority for all expressions of the supremacy of the Commonwealth; a
1475. recognition of the Church of England; and a repeal of the long-standing
1476. limitation of citizenship to church members. To one or two of their
1477. points the General Court gave consent. A comparison with the Code of
1478. 1672, shows that while the recognition of his majesty’s supremacy was
1479. allowed, in a score of instances the powers of the government under
1480. their Charter were asserted. The right of strangers to become citizens
1481. was nominally conceded, but on conditions which afforded only a minimum
1482. of relief to members of the Church of England.
1483. 
1484.   On the 3 August, 1664 it was Ordered by the General Court:
1485. 
1486.   _In Answer to that part of his Majestyes Letter_, of June 28, 1662,
1487.   _concerning admission of freemen_. This Court doth Declare, That the
1488.   Law prohibiting all persons, except Members of Churches, and, that
1489.   also for allowance of them in any County Court, are hereby Repealed,
1490.   And do hereby also Order and Enact That, from henceforth all English
1491.   men presenting a Certificate under the hand of the Ministers, or
1492.   Minister of the Place where they dwell, that they are Orthodox in
1493.   Religion, and not vicious in their Lives, and also a certificate
1494.   under the hands of the Select men of the place, or of the major Part
1495.   of them, that they are Free-holders: and are for their own propper
1496.   Estate (without heads of Persons) Rateable to the Country in a
1497.   single Country Rate, after the usuall manner of valuation in the
1498.   place where they live, to the full vallue of _Ten Shillings_, or
1499.   that they are in full Communion with some Church amongst us; It
1500.   shall be in the Liberty of all and every such Person or Persons,
1501.   being _twenty-four_ yeares of age, Householders and settled
1502.   Inhabitants in this Jurisdiction, from time to time to themselves
1503.   and their desires to this Court, for their addmittance to the
1504.   freedome of this commonwealth, and shall be allowed the priviledge,
1505.   to have such their desire Propounded and put to Vote in the General
1506.   Court, for acceptance to the freedome of the body pollitick, by the
1507.   sufferage of the major parte according to the Rules of our Patent.

1513. 
1514.   _Forasmuch as several Persons who from time to time are to be made
1515.   freemen, live remote and are not able without great trouble and
1516.   charge to appear before this Court to take their respective Oaths_:
1517.   It is therefore Ordered, that henceforth it shall be in the power of
1518.   any County Court, to administer the Oath of Freedome to any persons
1519.   approved of by the General Court who shall desire the same, any Law
1520.   or Custome to the contrary notwithstanding. [1664.]

1527.   It is ordered by this Court, & the authority thereof, that the

1594. 
1595. In their demand for changes in the 1660 Book of the General Laws and
1596. Liberties, the Commissioners in their 14th section proposed: “That, page
1597. 33, ‘none be admitted freemen but such as are members of some of the
1598. churches w^{th} in the limitts of this jurisdiction’ may be explained, &
1599. comp̄hend such as are members of y^e church of England.”

1604.   admitted to the freedome of this Colony or any in their behalf, give
1605.   a true copy out of this Courts Records, of their names, by them to

1628.   Att a Generall Court, held at Boston, 10^{th} of October, 1677.
1629. 
1630.   Whereas many secret attempts haue binn lately made by euil minded
1631.   persons to set fire in the toune of Boston and other places, tending
1632.   to the destruction of the whole, this Court doeth account it their
1633.   duty to vse all lawfull meanes to discouer such persons and prevent
1634.   the like for time to come.
1635. 
1636.   Bee it therefore ordered & enacted by this Court and the Authority
1637.   thereof, That the Law, _title_ Oathes and Subscriptions, page 120

1641.   And for the more effectual execution thereof, It is ordered by this
1642.   Court; That the select men, Constables, and Tithing-men, in every

1648.   hereby required forthwith to return the names of such persons unto
1649.   the next magistrate, or County Court, or chief military officer in
1650.   the town where no Magistrate is, who are required to give such
1651.   persons the said Oath prescribed in the Law, wherein not only
1652.   Fidelity to the Country, but Allegiance to our King, is required;
1653.   And all such as take the said oath shall be Recorded and Enrolled in
1654.   the County Records by the clerk of each County Court. And all such

1657.   such refusers to take the said Oath shall not have the benefit of
1658.   our Laws to Implead, Sue, or recover any Debt in any Court or Courts

1675.   Att the second sessions of the Gen̄ll Court held at Boston, 2
1676.   October, 1678.
1677. 
1678.   _Whereas it hath pleased his most excellent Majesty, our gracious
1679.   king by his letter bearing date the twenty-seventh of Aprill, 1678,
1680.   to signifie his Royall pleasure, That the Authority of this his
1681.   Colony of Massachusetts in New-England, do give forth Orders that
1682.   the Oath of Allegiance, as it is by Law established within his
1683.   Kingdome of England, be administred and taken by all his subjects
1684.   within this Colony who are of years to take an oath_:
1685. 
1686.   In Obedience whereunto, and as a demonstration of our Loyalty; It is
1687.   ordered and enacted by this Court and the Authority thereof, that,
1688.   as the members of this Court now sitting have readily taken the Oath
1689.   of Allegiance, so, by their Example and Authority, they do require
1690.   and command that the same Oath be given and taken by all his
1691.   Majesties subjects within this Jurisdiction that are of sixteen
1692.   years of age and upwards. And to the end this Order be duely
1693.   executed, it is hereby Ordered, that a convenient number of printed
1694.   Copies of the said Oath of Allegiance, exactly agreeing with the
1695.   written copy inclosed in his majesties Letter, and signed by the
1696.   Secretary of State, to be sent forth unto every Magistrate and
1697.   Justice of peace, and to the Constable of every town within this
1698.   Jurisdiction.
1699. 
1700.   And it is further Ordered that the Magistrates and Justices, or such
1701.   as are Commissioned with Magistratical Authority in every County of
1702.   this Colony do with all convenient speed repair to the several Towns
1703.   and Villages within this Jurisdiction, at such time, and in such
1704.   order as they best may, and accomplish the same; giving forth their
1705.   warrant to the Constables of each Town to convene all the
1706.   inhabitants of the Age abovesaid, and taking their names in writing,
1707.   administer the said Oath of Allegiance to each of them, and return
1708.   their Names to the Recorder of each County Court to be enrolled. And
1709.   if any shall refuse to take the said Oath, or absent themselves
1710.   unless in case of sickness, the Names of such shall be returned to
1711.   the Recorder of the County, who are to be proceeded against by the
1712.   County Courts respectively, for the first offence whereof he is
1713.   legally convicted, to pay such a fine as the County Court shall
1714.   impose, not exceeding five pounds, or three Moneths Imprisonment in
1715.   the common prison or house of Correction: And for the second offence
1716.   whereof he shall be lawfully convicted, what summe the County Court
1717.   shall inflict, provided it exceed not ten pounds, or six Moneths
1718.   Imprisonment without Baile, or Mainprise. [1678.]
1719. 
1720. The officials of the Government, ignoring the copy of the Oath of
1721. Allegiance given them by the royal commissioners, took the Oath in Court
1722. as it is given in Michael Dalton’s “The Countrey Justice,”—a work of
1723. much esteem in its time, which passed through some ten or eleven
1724. editions, three of which are in the valuable Library of this Society,
1725. and one of them, there is reason to believe, may have been the volume
1726. used in this historical incident,—all of them declaring that the same is
1727. to be understood as not infringing the liberties and privileges granted
1728. in his Majesty’s royal Charter to this Colony of the Massachusetts.
1729. 
1730. Regarding the manner of taking the Oath; the New England custom was by
1731. holding up the right hand, as opposed to the custom in England of
1732. holding, or laying the hand on the Bible, or kissing it. This was one of
1733. the irritating questions in dispute between the Colonists and the Andros
1734. faction. Samuel Sewall, in his Diary, under date of June 11, 1686, says:
1735. “I read the Oath myself holding the book in my left hand, and holding up
1736. my right hand to Heaven.” And, in 1687, Increase Mather discoursed on
1737. the “laying the hand on and kissing the booke in swearing.” This
1738. question continued to irritate, and was one of the predisposing causes
1739. of the Revolutionary War in the Province of New York. In 1772, a Bill
1740. was lost in Council, “For Removing Doubts in the administration of
1741. Oaths.” This Bill was designed to favor a number of people, chiefly from
1742. Scotland and the north of Ireland, who held conscientious scruples
1743. against the present legal form of kissing the Bible; and allow them to
1744. use the form in use in Scotland and the New England Colonies of lifting
1745. up the right hand. The weight of Episcopal authority denied them this
1746. right.
1747. 
1748. In the colonization of New England the figure of John Winthrop looms
1749. colossal. Given time, he would have built an Empire whose only ruler
1750. would have been the Lord of Hosts. He can hardly be called a Puritan—his
1751. conversion came too late—but he was a Congregationalist. His method was
1752. so simple as to be open to the understanding of anyone, but it was a
1753. firm principle of government. As an illustration: when he was appealed
1754. to by a small group of settlers near the border line of New Hampshire
1755. for information as to how they could become freemen of the Colony of
1756. Massachusetts-Bay, his reply was: “Get a Minister.” When they answered
1757. that they had no Minister, and did not know where to get one, again came
1758. back his uncompromising reply: “Get a Minister.” In this reply rested
1759. his whole system of colonization. It was simplicity itself. The English
1760. Government recognized its power when, by Proclamation, they endeavored
1761. to prevent the emigration of Puritan Ministers from England. “Get a
1762. Minister!” Gather about him! Build him a church, and homes for
1763. yourselves and families. This done, you have a Plantation. When you have
1764. thus qualified to become freemen, and have taken the Oath of a Freeman,
1765. you will be entitled to hold office; assist in framing laws, and
1766. enforcing those already made; and, as members of the Commonwealth, be
1767. assured that all your rights will be protected. This principle of
1768. government was firm, but not repellent. If you could not conform to it
1769. there was no reason for remaining among them. The world was wide enough
1770. for every one. And you could go to Maine, or Rhode Island. Under it was
1771. formed a government that has never been equalled in prosperity, morality
1772. and all that makes for happiness. No less a personage than Hugh Peters
1773. has declared that in the six years of his residence in the Colony of
1774. Massachusetts-Bay, he had never seen a drunken man or heard a profane
1775. oath.
1776. 
1777. The limits of their territory they continually enlarged by firmly
1778. insisting upon the border lines of their Patent, and even stretching
1779. them when near some natural boundary; by purchasing the rights of New
1780. Plymouth in the Colony of Maine, for 400 pounds, they added a tract of
1781. seven hundred square miles; by the purchase of the Gorges Patent, for
1782. 1,250 pounds sterling, they acquired a jurisdiction over the rest of the
1783. Province of Maine which made it a District of Massachusetts down to the
1784. year 1820. There has been a good deal of sympathy, and many unnecessary
1785. tears have been shed over the so-called banishment of Roger Williams to
1786. Rhode Island; but it was his friend, John Winthrop, who whispered in his
1787. ear the desirability of the location of the Providence Plantations. And
1788. there was no reason why Roger Williams could not have gone out from
1789. Salem with head erect, and with his gaze fixed on the stars, as every
1790. good missionary should go, knowing that the powers of the government of
1791. Massachusetts-Bay was as much behind his settlement, without an Oath, as
1792. it was behind the colonists of Connecticut, and New Haven, who had gone
1793. out from Cambridge, Watertown and Roxbury, carrying with them the Oath
1794. of a Freeman as a principle of their governments. In the Union of the
1795. Colonies of Massachusetts-Bay, New Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven,
1796. of which John Winthrop was the first President, a new idea was advanced
1797. in his system of government, which eventually attained greater results.
1798. 
1799. It cannot be said that John Winthrop accomplished these things unaided.
1800. There were others who ably assisted him, whose names, also, should be
1801. held in honored remembrance. But through it all, can be seen the firm,
1802. directing mind and purpose of a man whose vision looked beyond his
1803. present to a future, and a Republic that was to be.
1804. 
1805. And this is why our people should look upon The Oath of a Freeman, which
1806. was his work, not alone as the glorious first fruit of the
1807. Printing-Press in this Country; but also as a great state paper which
1808. accomplished without bloodshed, on a smaller scale it is true, all that
1809. was achieved, one hundred and thirty-seven years later, after seven
1810. years of warfare, through the Declaration of Independence.

1813. 
1814. 
1815. _In Connecticut and New Haven Colonies._
1816. 
1817. 
1818. The colonists of Connecticut, in the main, followed closely the general
1819. system of laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, from which they had
1820. emigrated. Their form of government was theocratic, the Oath of a
1821. Freeman being the test of citizenship. The settlers of Windsor, who came
1822. from Dorchester with John Warham, in 1635, did not, however, make church
1823. membership a necessary qualification for holding civil office.
1824. 
1825. The settlers of Guilford, who were joined to New Haven Colony, exercised
1826. their powers of government by a system which conformed to the grant from
1827. Lord Say and Brook to Theophilus Eaton and his company. Like that at New
1828. Haven it was an aristocracy, but modelled in a singular way. As a part
1829. of New Haven Colony they were entitled to one Magistrate, who was their
1830. head and invested with the whole executive and judicial power. The
1831. settlers were divided into two classes, freemen and planters. The
1832. freemen could consist only of those who were church members, and partook
1833. of the sacrament. They were all under oath agreeably to their form of
1834. government. Out of their number were chosen three or four deputies to
1835. sit with the Magistrate in General Courts, and all public officers. The
1836. planters consisted of all inhabitants above the age of twenty-one years,
1837. with a certain estate, which qualified them to vote in town meetings.

1863. all that were admitted freemen up to July 1640, was as follows:

1911.   At a Generall Assembly held at Hartford, Aprill 20th, 1665, there
1912.   was presented to the Court the Propositions of his Majesty’s Royal
1913.   Commission which were read and answered as follows;
1914. 
1915.   1. That all householders inhabiting this Colony take the oath of
1916.   allegiance, and that the administration of justice be in his
1917.   Majesties name.
1918. 
1919.   To this we returne, that according to his Majesties pleasure exprest
1920.   in o^r Charter, o^r Gouernour formerly hath nominated and appoynted
1921.   meet persons to administer the oath of allegiance, whoe haue,
1922.   according to their order, administred the s^d oath to seuerall
1923.   persons allready; and the administration of justice amongst us hath
1924.   been, is and shall be in his Majesties name.
1925. 
1926.   2nd Propos: That all men of competent estates and of ciuill
1927.   conuersation, though of different judgments, may be admitted to be
1928.   freemen, and haue liberty to chuse or to be chosen officers, both
1929.   military and ciuill.
1930. 
1931.   To the 2d, our order for admission of freemen is consonant w^{th}
1932.   that proposition.

2116. The settlement of Rhode Island by Roger Williams, being partly
2117. occasioned by his refusal to take either the Oath of Fidelity, or the
2118. Stranger’s Oath to the Colony of Massachusetts-Bay will account for the

2120. which he founded. From the first settlement of the Colony of Rhode
2121. Island and Providence Plantations to the present time an Oath could not

2137. This limiting of the powers of town meetings to “civil things,” is the
2138. first expression in the new world of a severance of the bonds of Church
2139. and State, and of that principle of freedom of conscience for which the

2306.   according to the best of your skill and knowledge without
2307.   partiallyty or affection to any; and that according to the lawes
2308.   already established, or to be established in this Colony. This
2309.   ingagement you make and ingage to obsearve, vnder the penalty of
2310.   perjury....
2311. 
2312.   At the taking of the ingagement by any, ther must bee a
2313.   re-engagement given in the Colloneys name, to stand by and assist
2314.   such parsones in the exicution of ther offices and performance of
2315.   ther dutyes.
2316. 
2317.   It is alsoe the pleasuer and appoynment of this Generall Assembly,
2318.   that none presume to vote in the matters afforesayd, but such whome
2319.   this Generall Assembly expresly by ther writting shal admit as
2320.   freemen.
2321. 
2322.   The 19^{th} of the ii^{th} Month, 1645. Wee whose names are heere
2323.   after Subscribed, having obteyned a free Grante of Twenty five Akers
2324.   of Land a peece with right of Commoning, according to the said
2325.   proportion of Land; from the free Jnhabitants of this Towne of
2326.   providence; doe thankfully acsept of the same; And heereby doe
2327.   promise to yield Actiue; or passiue Obeydience to the authority of
2328.            established in this Collonye; according to our Charter; and
2329.   to all Such wholesome Lawes & Orders, that are or shall be made, by
2330.   the major consent of this Towne of Providence; As alsoe not to
2331.   clayme any Righte, to the Purchasse of the Said plantation; Nor any
2332.   privilidge of Vote in Towne Affaires; untill we shall be received as
2333.   free = Men of the said Towne of Providence. [1645.]
2334. 
2335. 
2336.                 THE PREAMBLE TO THE LAW AGAINST PERJURY
2337. 
2338.   Forasmuch as the consciences of sundry men, truly conscionable, may
2339.   scruple the giving or the taking of an oath, and it would be nowise
2340.   suitable to the nature and constitution of our place, who profess
2341.   ourselves to be men of different consciences and not one willing to
2342.   force another to debar such as cannot do so, either from bearing
2343.   office among us or from giving in testimony in a case depending; be
2344.   it enacted by the authority of this present Assembly, that a solemn
2345.   profession or testimony in a court of record, or before a judge of
2346.   record, shall be accounted, throughout the whole colony, of as full
2347.   force as an oath. [1647.]
2348. 
2349. This is the more remarkable because at this time the Friends did not yet
2350. as a distinct Society, hold to the unlawfulness of oaths. And it is in
2351. complete concordance with the teachings of Roger Williams.
2352. 
2353.   Acts and Orders of the Generall Assembly, sitting at Newport, May
2354.   the 3, 1665.
2355. 
2356.   Ordered, that this following shall be the forme for engaging all
2357.   officers in this Collony, called to place of publicke concernment,
2358.   &c., for the administration of justice, (viz):
2359. 
2360.   Whereas, you are, A. B., by the free vote of the freemen of this
2361.   Collony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, &c., called and
2362.   chosen vnto the place and office of ——, in the said Collony, &c.,
2363.   doe sollemly engage true eleageance vnto his Majestye, his heires
2364.   and successors, to beare, and in your said office equall justice and
2365.   right to doe vnto all persones within this jurisdiction to the
2366.   vtmost or best of your skill and ability without partiality,
2367.   according to the laws established, or that shall be established in
2368.   this said jurisdiction; [according to the Charter as well in matters
2369.   military as civill.] And this engagement you make and give vpon the
2370.   perill of the penalty of perjury.
2371. 
2372.   The reciprocall engagement is as follows, ordered to be given by he
2373.   that takes or administers the abovesaid engagement.
2374. 
2375.   I doe, in the name and behalfe of this Collony, &c., re-ingage to
2376.   stand by you and to support you by all due assistance and
2377.   incouradgment in your performance and execution of your aforesaid
2378.   office according to your engagement.
2379. 
2380.   Ordered, that the forme of engagement aforesaid shall be used vntill
2381.   further order; any former order or forme vsed or prescribed to the
2382.   contrary, or differing herefrom notwithstanding. [1665.] These forms
2383.   were re-enacted in 1677.
2384. 
2385. The Commission appointed by the King to assert the rights of the Crown
2386. to the seven New England Colonies, as the first of the propositions of
2387. his Majesty’s will and pleasure in Rhode Island, proposed:
2388. 
2389.   That all householders inhabiting this Collony take the oath of
2390.   alleagence and the administration of justice be in his Majestyes
2391.   name.
2392. 
2393.   Wherevpon, and in a deepsence of his Majestyes most Royall and
2394.   wonderful grace and favour more pertickerlerly ... in his letters
2395.   pattents ... in which is expresed his ... indulgence extended to
2396.   tender consiences, differing in matters of religious worshipe and
2397.   conceanments; and more especially in matters of formes of oathes and
2398.   cerimonyes or circumstances relating therevnto, ... considering
2399.   therein the liberty of concience therein granted.
2400. 
2401.   The Assembly doe with one consent ... in all cheerfull obediance ...
2402.   and therein minding the preveledge granted to tender conciences, doe
2403.   in the first place order and declare: that whereas in this Collony
2404.   it hath ben alwayes accounted and granted a liberty to such as make
2405.   a scruple of swearing and taken an oath, that in stead thereof they
2406.   shall engage, under the penalty of false swearing, though they
2407.   sweare not in publicke engagement, as well as if they did sweare,
2408.   that therefore this most loyall and resonable engagement be given by
2409.   all men capable within this jurisdiction for their allegiance to the
2410.   King, &c.
2411. 
2412.                   *       *       *       *       *
2413. 
2414.   The forme of which engagement shall be as followeth:
2415. 
2416.   You, A. B., sollemly and sincearly engage true and faithfull
2417.   aleagiance vnto his Majestye Charles the Second, King of England,
2418.   his heires and successors, to beare and due obediance vnto the lawes
2419.   established, from time to time in this jurisdiction, to yeald vnto
2420.   the vtmost of your power, according to the previlidge by his said
2421.   Majesty granted, in religioues and civill concearnments to this
2422.   Collony in the Charter; which said engagement you make vnder the
2423.   perill and penalty of perjury. [1665.]
2424. 
2425. They further ordered that “this engagement shall be administered to all
2426. that are already admitted freemen, and that no man shall be admitted a
2427. freeman, and all men that are householders or aged eighteen or more,
2428. shall take the engagement or loose the priviledge of freemen until they
2429. give the engagement premised.” The passage of this law led to a long
2430. agitation by those who thought it to be hard on the consciences by many
2431. whom it rendered incapable from carrying on the affairs of the
2432. corporation. And, in the following year, the Assembly ordered and
2433. declared, “That such as are free in their conscience so to do, give the
2434. Engagement, or if they rather choose to give the oath of allegiance now
2435. required in England, that shall be taken; but if there are some words in
2436. either which, in conscience they cannot condescend to say or use, may in
2437. open court, or before two Magistrates adopt in equivalent words
2438. significant of allegiance and submission to yield obedience actively and
2439. passively, to the laws made by virtue of his Majesty’s authority, he
2440. shall be restored or admitted as freeman, any former law to the contrary
2441. notwithstanding.”
2442. 
2443.   At a Court held in his Majesty’s name, and under his authority, at
2444.   the towne of Westerly, in the King’s Province, the 17th of
2445.   September, 1679.
2446. 
2447.   The inhabitants of Westerly, being by warrant required to appeare at
2448.   this Court to give the oath of allegiance to his Majesty, and of
2449.   fidellity to his Majesty’s authority for this Collony, these persons
2450.   hereunder named appeared and gave oath, viz. [Thirty-three names.]
2451. 
2452.   The oath given by the above written persons was in these followinge
2453.   words:
2454. 
2455.   I doe truly and sincerely acknowledge, profess, testify and declare
2456.   in my conscience before God and the world, that our Soverreign Lord,
2457.   King Charles, is lawfull and rightfull King of the Realm of England,
2458.   and of all other his dominions and countries; and that the Pope,
2459.   neither of himselfe, nor by any authority of the Church, or See of
2460.   Rome, or by any other meanes with any other, hath any power or
2461.   authority to depose the King, or to dispose of his Majesty’s
2462.   kingdoms or dominions, or to authorize any forreigne prince to
2463.   invade, or annoy him, or his country, or to discharge any of his
2464.   subjects from their allegiance and obedience to his Majesty; or to
2465.   give license or leave to any of them to beare armes, raise tumults,
2466.   or offer any violence or hurt to his Majesty’s Royall person, State
2467.   or Government, or to any of his Majesty’s subjects within his
2468.   Majesty’s dominions. Alsoe I doe sweare from my heart, that
2469.   notwithstanding any declaration or sentence of ex-communication, or
2470.   deprivation, made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope
2471.   or his successors, or by any authority derived or pretended to be
2472.   derived from him or his See against the said King, his heires or
2473.   successors, or any absolution of the said subjects from their
2474.   obedience, I will beare faith and true allegiance to his Majesty,
2475.   his heires and successors, and him and them will defend to the
2476.   uttermost of my power against all conspiracies and attempts
2477.   whatsoever which shall be made against his or their persons, their
2478.   Crowne and dignity, by reason or clause of any such sentence or
2479.   declaration or otherwise, and will doe my best endeavour to
2480.   disclose, and make knowne unto his Majesty, his heires and
2481.   successors, all treasons and traiterous conspiracies, which I shall
2482.   know or hear of, to be against him or any of them. And I doe further
2483.   sweare that I doe from my heart, abhor, detest and abjure as impious
2484.   and herritical, this damnable doctrine and position, that princes
2485.   which be excommunicated or deprived by the Pope, may be deposed or
2486.   murthered by their subjects, or any other whatsoever. And I doe
2487.   believe and in my conscience am resolved, that neither the Pope nor
2488.   any person whatsoever, hath power to absolve me of this oath, or any
2489.   part thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full authority to bee
2490.   ministered unto me; and doe renounce all pardons and dispensations
2491.   to the contrary. And all these things I doe plainly and sincerely
2492.   acknowledge and sweare according to these express words by me
2493.   spoken, according to the plaine and common sense and understandinge
2494.   of the same words, without any equivocation or mentall evasion or
2495.   secrett reservation whatsoever. And further, I doe here solemnly
2496.   engage all true and loyall obedience unto his Majesty’s authority
2497.   placed and established in this his Collony of Rhode Island and
2498.   Providence Plantations, and King’s Province. And I doe make this
2499.   recognition heartily, willingly, and truly, upon the true faith of a
2500.   Christian. So help me God. [1679.]
2501. 
2502. No further oaths, or engagements, appear until the Administration of Sir
2503. Edmund Andros, in 1686, reduced the Colony to the nature of a County
2504. under his government.

2509. _In New Hampshire Colony._
2510. 
2511. 
2512. As there was no constituted authorities over the patent of New
2513. Hampshire, the Exeter settlers, under the leadership of John
2514. Wheelwright, who had purchased a tract thirty miles square from certain
2515. Indian Sachems in April, 1638, were driven to the expedient of agreeing
2516. upon a voluntary association for governmental purposes. The executive
2517. and judicial functions were vested in a board of three magistrates or
2518. elders, of whom the chief was styled Ruler. They were chosen by the
2519. whole body of freemen, who were the electors and legislators, their
2520. enactments, however, requiring the approval of the Ruler. An inhabitant
2521. had to be admitted a freeman, before he could enjoy the privileges of an
2522. elector. Under this association, an agreement was drawn up by the
2523. Reverend John Wheelwright, their leader, as follows:
2524. 
2525. 
2526.  THE COMBINATION FOR GOVERNMENT AT EXETER, WITH THE FORMS OF OATHS FOR
2527.                            RULERS AND PEOPLE
2528. 
2529.   Whereas it hath pleased the lord to moue the heart of our Dread
2530.   Soveraigne Charles by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland,
2531.   France & Ireland, to grant license & liberty to sundry of his
2532.   subjects to plant themselves in the Westerne partes of America: Wee,
2533.   his loyall subjects, brethren of the church of Exeter, situate &
2534.   lying upon the river of Piscataquacke, wh other inhabitants there,
2535.   considering w^{th} ourselves the holy will of god and our owne
2536.   necessity, that we should not live w^{th}out wholsome lawes &
2537.   government amongst us, of w^{ch} we are altogether destitute; doe in
2538.   the name of Christ & in the sight of god combine ourselves together,
2539.   to erect & set up amongst us such government as shall be to our best
2540.   discerning, agreeable to the will of god, professing ourselves
2541.   subjects to our Soveraigne Lord King Charles, according to the
2542.   libertys of our English Colony of the Massachusets & binding
2543.   ourselves solemnely by the grace & helpe of Christ & in his name &
2544.   feare to submit our selves to such godly & Christian laws as are
2545.   established in the realme of England to our best knowledge, & to all
2546.   other such lawes wch shall upon good grounds be made & inacted
2547.   amongst us according to god y^t we may live quietly & peaceably
2548.   together in all godliness and honesty. Mon. 5th d., 4th, 1639. [John
2549.   Whelewright, and thirty-four others.]
2550. 
2551. This was soon found to be unsatisfactory to some other settlers, who
2552. thought its expressions too lavish of loyalty to the King, and, in
2553. consequence, of prelacy; and while they were willing to acknowledge in a
2554. general way his sovereignty, and that they were his subjects, they had
2555. no disposition to make any unnecessary professions of allegiance.
2556. Another compact was then drawn of the same purport, simply acknowledging
2557. the King to be their Sovereign, and themselves his subjects. This was
2558. executed in due form and went into effect as the basis of government.
2559. But it did not bear the test of trial. Curiously, because it did not
2560. contain loyalty enough. And the original Combination was re-executed
2561. with the following explanatory preamble:
2562. 
2563.   Whereas a certen combination was made by us, the brethren of the
2564.   Church of Exeter, with the rest of the Inhabitants, bearing date
2565.   Mon. 5th. d. 4, 1639, wh afterwards, upon the instant request of
2566.   some of the brethren, was altered, & put into such a forme of
2567.   wordes, wherein howsoever we doe acknowledge the King’s Majesty our
2568.   dread Sovereigne & ourselves his subjects: yet some expressions are
2569.   contained therein wh may seeme to admit of such a sence as somewhat
2570.   derogates from that due Allegiance wh we owe to his Highnesse, quite
2571.   contrary to our true intents and meanings: We therefore doe revoke,
2572.   disannull, make voyd and frustrate the said latter combination, as
2573.   if it never had beene done, and doe ratify, confirme and establish
2574.   the former, wh wee onely stand as being in force & virtue, the wh
2575.   for substance is here set downe in manner and form following. Mon.,
2576.   2d d., 2, 1640.
2577. 
2578. Both the Elders and the People were required to take certain prescribed
2579. oaths, as follows:
2580. 
2581. 
2582.                        THE ELDERS OR RULERS OATH
2583. 
2584.   You shall sweare by the great and dreadfull Name of the high God
2585.   maker & Gov^r of heaven and earth, and by the Lord Jesus Christ y^e
2586.   Prince of the Kings and Rulers of the earth that in his name and
2587.   feare you will Rule and Governe this people according to the
2588.   righteous will of God’s Ministeringe Justice and Judgm^t upon the
2589.   workers of iniquity and Ministering due incurreagm^t and Countenance
2590.   to well doers protecting of people so farre as in you by the helpe
2591.   of God lyeth from forren Annoyance and inward disturbance that they
2592.   may live a quiett and peacable life in all godlyness and honesty.
2593.   Soe God bee helpful and gratious to you and yo^{rs} in Christ Jesus.
2594. 
2595. 
2596.                          THE OATH OF THE PEOPLE
2597. 
2598.   Wee doe here sweare by the Great and dreadful name of y^e high God,
2599.   maker and Gouern^r of Heaven & earth and by the Lord Jesus X y^e
2600.   King & Savio^r of his people that in his name & fear we will submitt
2601.   o^r selves to be ruld & gouerned by, according to y^e will & Word of
2602.   God and such holsome Laws & ordinances as shall be derived theire
2603.   from by O^r honr^d Rulers and y^e Lawfull assistance with the
2604.   consent of y^e people and y^t wee will be ready to assist them by
2605.   the helpe of God in the administration of Justice and p^rservacon of
2606.   peace with o^r bodys and goods and best endeavo^{rs} according to
2607.   God, so God protect & saue us and O^{rs} in Christ Jesus. [1640.]
2608. 
2609. 
2610.           THE COMBINATION OF THE PEOPLE OF DOVER TO ESTABLISH
2611.                           A FORM OF GOVERNMENT
2612. 
2613.   Whereas sundry Mischiefes and inconveniences have befaln us, and
2614.   more and greater may in regard of want of Civill Government, his
2615.   Gratious Matie haveing hitherto settled no Order for us to our
2616.   knowledge:
2617. 
2618.   Wee whose names are underwritten being inhabitants upon the River
2619.   Piscataquack have voluntarily agreed to combine our selves into a
2620.   Body Politique that wee may the more comfortably enjoy the benefit
2621.   of his Maties Lawes. And do hereby actually ingage our Selves to
2622.   Submit to his Royal Maties Lawes together with all such Orders as
2623.   shalbee concluded by a Major part of the Freemen of our Society, in
2624.   case they bee not repugnant to the Lawes of England and administered
2625.   in the behalfe of his Majesty.
2626. 
2627.   And this wee have mutually promised and concluded to do and so to
2628.   continue till his Excellent Matie shall give other Order concerning
2629.   us.
2630. 
2631.   In Witness wee have hereto Set our hands the two & twentieth day of
2632.   October in the sixteenth yeare of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord

2634.   Defender of the Faith &c. Annoq Domi, 1640. [John Follett, and
2635.   forty-one others.]
2636. 
2637. Under these forms the administration of the affairs of Exeter, and
2638. Dover, went on satisfactorily until, together with Hampton and
2639. Portsmouth, they came under the sway of Massachusetts-Bay in 1643; a
2640. part of the price the latter were ready to pay for the extension of
2641. their jurisdiction was that the citizens of the New Hampshire towns were
2642. to be allowed the elective franchise without reference to their being
2643. church members. This arrangement continued under the Laws of
2644. Massachusetts-Bay, as a part of Norfolk County, until New Hampshire
2645. became, in 1680, a Royal Province.
2646. 
2647.   In the Generall Lawes and Liberties of the Province of New
2648.   Hampshire, made by the Generall Assembly in Portsm^o the 16th of
2649.   March, 1679/80 and Aproved by the Presid^t and Councill. The
2650.   following is given as the status of

2656.   Englishmen being Protestants, y^t are settled Inhabitants and
2657.   freeholders in any towne of this Province, of y^e age of 24 years,

2680. The Colonization of what is called in the Charter granted by Charles the
2681. First to Sir Ferdinando Gorges in 1639, “The Province or Countie of
2682. Mayne,” presented many difficulties. The extraordinary governmental
2683. powers given to the Lord-Proprietary, which were transmissible with the
2684. property to his heirs and assigns, made of it a vast landed estate in
2685. which there could not be much voluntary co-operation. To assist in its
2686. government a board of Councilors was appointed who before taking office
2687. were required to “take the Oath of Allegiance according to the forme now
2688. used in this his highness’ realme of England, and shall alsoe take the
2689. Oath hereunto subscribed.”
2690. 
2691. 
2692.                 OATH OF COUNCILORS OF PROVINCE OF MAYNE
2693. 
2694.   I do swear and protest before God Allmighty and by the holy contents
2695.   of this Book to be a faithfull Servant and Councellor unto Sir
2696.   Ferdinando Gorges Knight my Lord of the Province of Mayne, and to
2697.   his heirs and assigns, to do and perform to the utmost of my power
2698.   all dutiful respects to him or them belonging, concealing their
2699.   Councells, and without respect of persons to do, perform and give my
2700.   opinion in all causes according to my conscience, and best
2701.   understanding both as I am a Councellor for hearing of causes, and
2702.   otherwise freely to give him or them my opinion as I am a Councellor
2703.   for matters of State or Common-wealths and that I will not conceal
2704.   from him or them and their Councell any matter of conspiracy or
2705.   mutinous practice against my said Lord and his heirs but will
2706.   instantly after my knowledge thereof discover the same, and
2707.   prosecute the authors thereof with all diligence and severity
2708.   according to Justice, and thereupon do humbly kiss the Book. Taken
2709.   September 2, 1639.
2710. 
2711. On the death of Sir Ferdinando in 1647, his estate in Maine passed to
2712. his son, John Gorges, who totally neglected his inheritance not even
2713. replying to repeated letters from the Gorges Colonists.
2714. 
2715. A Patent for lands on the Kennebeck River had been given to the New
2716. Plymouth Colony in 1629. In 1649, they let the trade upon it for a
2717. period of three years to Governor William Bradford, and four associates.
2718. In 1652, the trade was sold to the same men for three years longer. In
2719. that year, from actual survey, the east line of the Massachusetts-Bay
2720. Colony was found to encroach upon the liberties of the trade sold by and
2721. to the New Plymouth officers; and, in 1653, Thomas Prence was authorized
2722. to summon all and every inhabitant of the Kennebeck country to assemble
2723. and receive from him the instructions of the Plymouth General Court: “1.
2724. That the people should take the Oath of fidelity to the State of
2725. England, and to the government of New Plymouth. 2. That they were to be
2726. made acquainted with the Colony laws, applicable to them, and establish
2727. suitable rules and regulations to guide and govern them in their civil
2728. affairs. 3. None were to be inhabitants there but such as should take
2729. the Oath of Allegiance. 4. None could vote for an Assistant but such as
2730. should take the Oath.”
2731. 
2732. The Oath required was in these words:
2733. 
2734.   You shall be true and faithfull to the State of England, as it is
2735.   now established, and whereas you chuse at present to reside within
2736.   the government of New Plymouth, you shall not do, or cause to be
2737.   done, any act, or acts, directly or indirectly by land or water,
2738.   that shall, or may tend to the destruction or overthrow of the whole
2739.   or part of this government, that shall be ordered, erected or
2740.   established; but shall contrarywise, hinder, oppose, or discover
2741.   such intents and purposes, as tend thereunto, to those that are in
2742.   place for the time being; that the government may be informed
2743.   thereof with all convenient speed; You shall also submitt, and
2744.   observe all such good and wholesome laws, ordinances, and officers
2745.   as are, or shall be established within the several limits thereof,
2746.   So help you God, who is the God of Truth and the punisher of
2747.   falsehood. [1653.]
2748. 
2749. This action constituted them freemen of Massachusetts, on taking the
2750. Oath, without the prerequisite of church membership. It was followed by
2751. a growing discontent against the chief officers in New Plymouth being
2752. lessees of the trade. The large returns which had been confidently
2753. expected were not being realized, and a jealousy of the people against
2754. those in power, finally led to the sale of the Patent, embracing seven
2755. hundred square miles, to a committee representing the Massachusetts-Bay
2756. Colony, for four hundred pounds. In 1677, after much controversy and
2757. trouble with the heirs, Ferdinando Gorges, a grandson of the
2758. Lord-Proprietary, sold his rights to the Massachusetts-Bay Colony for
2759. one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds sterling, and the Territory of
2760. Maine became a District of Massachusetts down to the year 1820.

2763. 
2764. The power of an Oath is a subject for the Casuist. But, in the brief
2765. period of this paper—less than the span of life the Psalmist gives to
2766. man—we have seen an Oath throne and dethrone monarchs; build up and
2767. destroy flourishing Commonwealths; make and unmake Statehoods; be a
2768. guarantee of peace, and an incentive for war. Who, under these
2769. conflicting conditions, can measure their influence but Him in whose
2770. name and power they are made!

3104. array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
3105. ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
3106. status with the IRS.
3107. 
3108. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
3109. charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
3110. States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
3111. considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
3112. with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
3113. where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
3114. DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
3115. state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
3116. 
3117. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
3118. have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
3119. against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
3120. approach us with offers to donate.
3121. 
3122. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
3123. any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
3124. outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
3125. 
3126. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
3127. methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
3128. ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

3131. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
3132. 
3133. Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
3134. Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
3135. freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
3136. distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
3137. volunteer support.
3138. 
3139. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
3140. editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
3141. the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
3142. necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
3143. edition.
3144. 
3145. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
3146. facility: www.gutenberg.org
3147. 
3148. This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
3149. including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
3150. Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
3151. subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
