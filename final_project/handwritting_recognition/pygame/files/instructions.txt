How to play AI Roulette:
1. Play with 2 or more players
2. Pick an AI to play with. Choose wisely, as some AIs are better than others. Some information regarding the AI is available to help you decide
3. Make a drawing of any alphabet character, or any number from 0 to 9. The AI will try to guess what it is.
4. If the AI guessed it incorrectly, the player who chose the AI and drew gets a punishment. Otherwise, every other player gets the punishment. Punishment can be in any form, such as a round of truth or dare, push-ups, sing, etc.
5. Then take turns with another player to try their luck with the AI.
6. Have fun :)
