You can get a feel with neural networks by visiting playground.tensorflow.org
Tensorflow is a great library for creating neural networks!
Keras makes writing neural network code much easier!
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are usually used for image identification
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can be used to read sentences
More layers does not always mean a better neural network!
Tensorflow can utilize your GPU for faster processing, but it only works on NVidia cards...
Neural Networks "immitates" your brain's biological neural pathways!
The three basic layers of a neural network are the input, hidden, and output layers
