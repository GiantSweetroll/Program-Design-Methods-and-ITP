You can get a feel with neural networks by visiting playground.tensorflow.org
Tensorflow is a great library for creating neural networks!
Keras is a high-level API that makes writing neural network code much easier!
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are usually used for image identification
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can be used to read sentences
More layers or neurons does not always mean a better neural network!
Tensorflow can utilize your GPU for faster processing, but it only works on NVidia cards...
Neural Networks "immitates" your brain's biological neural pathways!
The three basic layers of a neural network are the input, hidden, and output layers
A larger training dataset usually makes your neural network more accurate and precise
Dropout layers forces neurons to distribute the workload by ignoring the result of several neurons!
Neural networks learn by using a technique called Backpropagation
Each layer has a number of neurons that hold constantly changing weights during training...
Deep Convolutional Neural Network is the pinnacle model for image classification
More layers usually makes the training process faster
A hidden layer can consist of any number of layers
A neural network will select the answer with the highest probability of success
Keras is easier but slower than directly using Tensorflow
Tensorflow is more complicated but faster than using Keras
Trial and error goes a long way in creating the best neural network models!
Model zoos provides you with a lot of trained neural network models that you can use
MNIST database provides you with over 80,000 data samples for number recognition...
Overfitting is when your neural network reinforces its mistakes from past training iterations
Dropout layers can help deal with overfitting
Creating a neural network requires commitment, patience,... and a huge chunk of luck!
